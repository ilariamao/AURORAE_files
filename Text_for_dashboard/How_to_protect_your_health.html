<h2>How to protect your health </h2>
<p>According to the European Environment Agency (EEA), the majority of urban residents in Europe are exposed to air pollution levels that exceed safe thresholds. 
Air pollution remains one of the most significant environmental health risks on the continent. The <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/air-pollution">EEA </a> has estimated a total of 239,000 premature deaths in 2022 
due to chronic exposure to fine particulate matter. Classified as a definitive carcinogen, air pollution is also linked to a range of health issues, including asthma, 
respiratory symptoms, pneumonia, acute and chronic bronchitis, heightened risk of heart attacks, and early mortality. Protecting yourself from air pollution is essential 
and can be done in simple steps, on daily, or a higher level.</br>

<h3>What to look for when checking for air quality?</h3>
<p> It is important for you to <b>check concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub></b> at your location every day. To ensure that your health is not impacted negatively, you can check if their air quality around reaches a higher limit than advised by the EU. You should be very careful when the PM<sub>10</sub> mean concentration in the 
air is above 45 &micro;g/m&sup3, the threshold, as indicated by the colour red on the map of AURORAE. 
The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/2881/oj/eng"> New European Directive on ambient air quality</a> has established new and stricter limits 
for various atmospheric pollutants, including PM<sub>10</sub>, to be attained by 2030 to better protect human health. The PM<sub>10</sub> <b>annual mean limit concentration</b>
has been lowered to <b>20 &micro;g/m&sup3</b> and the <b>daily mean concentration</b> of <b>45 &micro;g/m&sup3</b> should not be exceeded for more than 18 days per calendar year.
<b>The limit value is used by the legend on the service</b>. If the station nearest to you is coloured <b>orange</b> or <b>red</b>, the level of air quality is 
unhealthy and you should <b>follow our advice </b> below for immediate use. 
If air quality <b>consistently remains in the orange or red category (very rare)</b>, <b>long-term and permanent precaution</b>s should be implemented to safeguard your health.

<h3>Categories at risk</h3>
<p>If you belong to any of these groups, take additional precautions and carefully follow our guidance to safeguard your health:
<ul>
  <li>An elderly adult</li>
  <li>A child</li>
  <li>An individual with pre-existing respiratory conditions</li>
  <li>A cardiovascular patient</li>
  <li>Pregnant</li>
</ul>

<h3>Personal-level advices</h3>
<p>You can follow those adices to protect your health in case of high air pollution level (ORANGE and RED colors on the AURORAE map, PM<sub>10</sub> concentration higher than 45 &#181;</span>g/m<span>&#179;</span>>): 
<ul>
 <li>Wear close-fitting particulate respirators such as N-95 or FFP2 and FFP3 facemasks when going outdoor</li>
 <li>Avoid exercising outdoors and especially close to high-traffic areas or close to air pollution sources (especially for the elderly)</li>
 <li>Reduce the exertion level of your activity, for example, instead of jogging, walking</li>
 <li>Shift from motorised to active travel, such as cycling or walking, wearing a facemask</li>
 <li>Keep windows and doors closed to avoid deterioration of indoor air quality</li>
 <li>Avoid heating your home and cooking using the fireplace and woodstoves. If using, follow best practices as explained in <a href="https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/2107194_Inside_EN_pdf%20web.pdf">
Code of good practice for wood-burning and small combustion installations</a> by UNECE, for example, burn dry seasoned wood, and not wet logs or ever start a fire with kerosene, gasoline, or charcoal starter.</li>
 <li>Choose cobalt-free hard metal tire studs instead of traditional studded tires for your car during wintertime</li>
 <li>Invest in portable air cleaners, Central air cleaners/heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipped with HEPA filters </li>
</ul>
<h3>Community-level advices</h3>
<p>Here are some advices that could be implemented at community-level: 
<ul>
 <li>Open or expand community centers to provide safe, indoor venues for physical exercise and social engagement, reducing reliance on outdoor activities during high pollution or extreme weather events</li>
 <li>Organize informative events for the community and classes for kids to inform them about air pollution health-related risks</li>
 <li>Establish a local network of information about air pollution levels accessible to the majority of the citizens</li>
</ul>

<h1>About AURORAE</h1>
<h2>What is the AURORAE (Air qUality foRecast fOR Arctic communitiEs) service?</h2>

<p>The AURORAE service is a web page designed for Arctic and North European Communities (Finland, Sweden, Norway and Iceland) to provide real-time air quality data and forecast for the following 48 hours (2 days). 
It consists of an interactive map which provides updated PM<sub>10</sub> (particulate matter) concentrations and a forecast for each air quality monitoring station. Every station is represented by a dot designed to communicate whether air quality is healthy or unhealthy depending on color (green, yellow, orange and red).</br> 
<br>The user can choose to zoom out the map and get the bigger picture of air quality status in the Nordic countries or can zoom in at a single monitoring station. Selecting a specific station on the map, the user can get information such as the geographical position of the station, the instrument used for the measurements,
the air quality network and can also visualize the PM<sub>10</sub> time series and the forecast over time. The forecast is performed using a novel approach that involves the application of artificial intelligence. 
AURORAE provide current air quality data and forecast for more than 100 cities and communities across the European arctic and North Europe. The tool is accessible without registration and is intended for a wide range of users such as citizens, communities’ leaders, policymakers, educators, students and everyone interested in taking steps to protect their health.</br></p>

<h2>Arctic PASSION</h2>
<p>The AURORAE web tool is developed by the <a href="https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/index_en">European Commission Joint Research Center</a> and the  
<a href="https://en.iia.cnr.it/">Italian Institute for Air Pollution Research</a> in the framework of the EU Horizon 2020 <a href="https://arcticpassion.eu/">Arctic PASSION project</a>. 
The research project aims to refine, improve and extend pan-Arctic scientific and community-based monitoring systems, 
with a focus on creating a coherent and integrated Arctic observing system that is tailored to the needs of users or 
stakeholders. </p>

<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>Arctic PASSION project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 101003472.</p>
